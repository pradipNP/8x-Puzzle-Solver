# 8x-Puzzle-Solver
## Project Overview
This project implements a solution to the classic 8-puzzle problem using AI search algorithms. The goal is to solve a sliding puzzle where the objective is to arrange the numbers in a specific order. This project uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to solve the puzzle efficiently.

## Algorithms Used
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Project Objective
To solve the 8-puzzle problem using AI-based search algorithms.
The project demonstrates how different algorithms can be applied to problem-solving in AI.

## Installation
No specific installation is required. Simply open the notebook in Google Colab or run the Python code locally.

## How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/8-puzzle-AI.git

## Run the Notebook:
You can run the 8-puzzle.ipynb file in Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook environment.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to solve the puzzle.

## Example
For example, if the puzzle is:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 _
where _ represents the empty space, the goal is to rearrange the tiles using the allowed moves until the puzzle reaches the goal state.

## Results
After running the algorithms, the notebook will show how the puzzle is solved step-by-step with the moves displayed.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
numpy
collections
